I learned that variables are placeholders for data used in the program

I learned about 4 different datatypes.
String - datatype that holds text
int - datatype that holds numbers not including decimals
double - datatype that holds numbers including decimals
boolean - datatype that holds either true or false

To declare a variable you begin with the datatype then the name of the variable followed with a ;
String name;
int name;
double name;
boolean name;

To apply data to a variable you have to set it equal to data that matches the variable's datatype
String name;
name = "hello";
OR
String name = "hello";

Arithmetic operators work similarly to how calculators work except you or the program has to assign variables a value
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 5;
System.out.println(num1 + num2); will equal 15
System.out.println(num1 - num2); will equal 5
System.out.println(num1 * num2); will equal 50
System.out.println(num1 / num2); will equal 2

You can also do the same with string variables
String text1 = "hello";
String text2 = "there";
System.out.println(text1 + text2); which will output "hellothere"
