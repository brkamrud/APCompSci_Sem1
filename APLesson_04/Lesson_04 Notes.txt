I learned how to create methods. They go in the class with the main but not in main
public class Thing
{

	public static void main(String[]args)
{
	//stuff
}

	public void method(String stuff, int num)
{
	//stuff
}

}

String stuff and int num in the method or what is called the parameters. They let data from outside the method be brought in and spit out

If you want to use a method, you have to instantiate and object that will let you use the method in main.
Thing objectname = new Thing();

To use a method you have to call the method and put in the values that the method wants
objectname.method(stuff2, num2);


Static is a modifier that lets the method be accessed in the class without instantiating an object

Void is a return type for a method that tells the method what value it will be returning. In this case, it tells the method to return null or no value at all.

Parameters is a placeholder for arguments to pass through the method. Only arguments that match the parameters can enter the method.


To return values from a non-static method, you have to use a return statement in the method.

public class Thing
{

	public static void main(String[]args)
{
	Thing callsMethods = new Thing();

	double value1 = 5;
	double value2 = 10;
	
	double retrievesTheValue = callsMethods.method(value1, value2); //the 2 value arguments are passed through the parameters of the method, used to assign returnValue and value and then returns that value to retrievesTheValue

}

	public double method(double num1, double num2)
{
	double returnValue = //math stuff

	return returnValue; //returns the value that was given to returnValue
}

}



If you want to call a method without having to instantiate an object, use parameters, and use a return statement, you use a static method.
A static method will be available everywhere in the class without having to do all of that stuff.

public class Sum
{


	public static void main(String[]args)
{	
	int sum = add(5,5);
	print(sum);

}

	public static int add(int one, int two)
{
	return one + two;


}

	public static void print(int s)
{
	System.out.println("The sum of your numbers is" + s );


}


}


Lesson 4 Questions:
1. It needs to be public so it can be called by outside programs and classes

2. It needs to be static so it can accessed by other methods in the class without having to instantiate an object

3. We need parameters because they allow arguments to enter the method so they can be used. Without them, methods would be pretty useless.

4. A static method can be accessed anywhere in the class without and object having to call it. A non-static method can only be accessed by being called by an object.

5. public class thing
{
	public static void main(String[]args)
{
	Scanner kb = new Scanner(System.in);
	
	System.out.println("Insert a # 1 - 5);
	int one = kb.nextInt();

	System.out.println("Insert another # 1 - 5);
	int two = kb.nextInt();

	System.out.println(one + " + " + two + " = " + methodYou());

}


	public static int methodYou()
{
	return one + two;

}


}
