I learned how to create methods. They go in the class with the main but not in main
public class Thing
{

	public static void main(String[]args)
{
	//stuff
}

	public void method(String stuff, int num)
{
	//stuff
}

}

String stuff and int num in the method or what is called the parameters. They let data from outside the method be brought in and spit out

If you want to use a method, you have to instantiate and object that will let you use the method in main.
Thing objectname = new Thing();

To use a method you have to call the method and put in the values that the method wants
objectname.method(stuff2, num2);
