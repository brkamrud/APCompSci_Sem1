To compile a program you need to use the NPPExec plugin in NP++ using the command:
//save the file
NPP_SAVE

//change to current directory
cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)"

//tell NP++ where java is
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_05\bin\javac $(FILE_NAME)

To execute a program, you use the same plugin and same command but instead of using "javac" and "FILE_NAME", you use "java" and "NAME_PART"

To print a string I need to use the command:
System.out.println("insert text here");

I had to make some ASCII art using that program so what I did was find some ASCII art and copy and paste each line into a new println command.
